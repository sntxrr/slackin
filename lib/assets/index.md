Once you submit the signup form you'll receive an email from Slack to continue
the signup process. Once you finish the signup process you can use Slack via
their web application or [download a desktop or mobile client](https://slack.com/downloads).

The Chef community is a mixture of professionals and volunteers who come from
all over the world and work together to make Chef better. Community members
fulfill many roles, including mentoring, teaching, and connecting with other
members of the community.  All participants in the Chef Community Slack agree to
follow the [Chef Community
Guidelines](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc020-community-guidelines.md).

### Slack Channels

By default
you will be added to the `#general` channel which is our general-purpose
discussion chat. Other more topic-specific channels are available in the
channels menu on the left.

### I Need Help With Slack!

You can check out Slack's [Help Center documentation](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us)
for answers to many common problems. If you are already logged in to Slack, you
can ask for assistance in the `#general` channel.

### Slack-tiquette

As with IRC, Slack has some of its own customs and etiquette. Our community
Slack is a volunteer-run organization so it is possible that there may be no
one around to help at times. Feel free to re-ask later on when more people are
around, or wait for a community member to check the recent scrollback.

Slack offers two channel-wide broadcast aliases: `@channel` and `@here`. Use
these very sparingly. Remember that use of these can send push notifications to
a large number of users, who may be confused or frustrated if the message was
less critical than they originally thought.

### FAQ

* **What Is Slack?**
  * Slack is a real-time chat system similar to IRC or Jabber. Here you can find
Chef community members to ask questions, learn more about Chef, or socialize
with our awesome community.
* **Why Slack?**
  * Chef used IRC for our community chat for many years, however stagnation of the
user experience for IRC combined with many improvements available from Slack
prompted us to reconsider this. You can read more about the rationale of the
move in [Chef RFC 74](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc074-community-slack.md).
* **Can I Use My Supermarket or Discourse Account?**
  * Unfortunately not at this time. For now your Slack account is independent of
the other Chef community tools.
* **Where Else Can I Find Help With Chef?**
  * We have a mailing list and forum at [discourse.chef.io](https://discourse.chef.io/)
if you prefer a more asynchronous approach. We also have volunteers on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/chef). If volunteer support isn't
available, you can reach Chef Software's support team at [support@chef.io](mailto:support@chef.io).
* **I Really Like IRC, What Do I Do?**
  * The `#chef` IRC channel will be bridge to Slack for the foreseeable future, so
you can continue to join in the discussion there, albeit with a reduced
experience. Additionally Slack does offer an [IRC gateway](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201727913-Connecting-to-Slack-over-IRC-and-XMPP),
though it has historically had some stability issues.
